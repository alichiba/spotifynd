The modern day rendition of a mixtape is Spotify playlists - people can make curated music experiences to share with their peers. Spotifynd aims to enhance that experience as a playlist creating tool for users to visualize the creation of their playlist (search for songs, see playlist draft, etc) and save it to their Spotify library. I tried to add a functionality to generate cover art for the playlists using Unsplash. This feature is not fully implemented, but I might revisit it someday. Potentially could use an AI art generator for the cover art instead to have an even more personal and unique playlist creating experience.
